== Features

* List system services on local machine or remote hosts
* Quickly deploy a new service using a template
* Start, Stop, Restart services, show status
* Easy search. Just start typing and the app will find relevant services
* Lightweight and easy on system resources (available in both Python and Rust versions)

== Download

Download from the https://github.com/mfat/systemd-pilot/releases[releases] section the package for your distribution.

== Building from Source

=== Rust Version (Recommended)

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mfat/systemd-pilot.git
cd systemd-pilot

# Initialize with pixi (installs Rust and dependencies)
pixi run pixi-init

# Build with pixi
pixi run build-release

# Run the application
pixi run run-release
----

=== Flatpak Version

[source,bash]
----
# Setup development environment first
pixi run dev-setup

# Build Flatpak (requires flatpak-builder)
pixi run flatpak-build

# Install locally
pixi run flatpak-install

# Run Flatpak version
pixi run flatpak-run
----

==== Requirements for Rust Version

* pixi package manager
* GTK 3.24 or later (system packages)
* Development packages for GTK, GLib, and related libraries (system packages)

NOTE: Rust and Cargo are managed by pixi - no manual installation required.

===== Fedora/RHEL Dependencies

[source,bash]
----
# Install system GTK development packages
sudo dnf install \
    gtk4-devel \
    glib2-devel \
    cairo-devel \
    pango-devel \
    gdk-pixbuf2-devel \
    pkg-config

# Check dependencies are available
pixi run check-system-deps
----

== Usage

=== Local Services Management

1. Launch the application
2. The *Local* tab shows all systemd services on your machine
3. Select a service to view its status and details
4. Use the control buttons to start, stop, restart, enable, or disable services
5. Click *Logs* to view service logs in real-time

=== Remote Host Management

1. Switch to the *Remote* tab
2. Click *Add Host* to configure a new remote server
3. Enter connection details (hostname, username, authentication method)
4. Connect to the host to manage its services remotely
5. All local operations are available for remote services

=== Filtering and Search

* Use the search box to quickly find services
* Toggle "Show inactive services" to see all services or just active ones
* Click column headers to sort the service list
