= Flatpak Packaging for systemd Pilot

This directory contains all the files necessary to package systemd Pilot as a Flatpak application.

== Files Overview

* *`io.github.mfat.systemdpilot.yml`* - Main Flatpak manifest defining the build process
* *`flathub.json`* - Flathub-specific configuration and metadata
* *`generated-sources.json`* - Auto-generated Cargo dependency sources for offline builds
* *`README.adoc`* - This documentation file

The manifest references files from the `../data/` directory for desktop integration.

== Building the Flatpak

=== Prerequisites

Install the required tools:

[source,bash]
----
# Install flatpak-builder
sudo apt install flatpak-builder

# Add Flathub repository
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# Install required runtime and SDK
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform//47 org.gnome.Sdk//47
----

=== Build Commands

From the project root directory:

[source,bash]
----
# Quick build check (no actual building)
pixi run flatpak-check

# Build the application
pixi run flatpak-build

# Build and install locally
pixi run flatpak-install

# Run the Flatpak version
pixi run flatpak-run

# Create a distributable bundle
pixi run flatpak-bundle
----

=== Manual Build Process

If you prefer to build manually:

[source,bash]
----
# Build the Flatpak
flatpak-builder build flatpak/io.github.mfat.systemdpilot.yml

# Install locally
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build flatpak/io.github.mfat.systemdpilot.yml

# Run the installed application
flatpak run io.github.mfat.systemdpilot
----

== Development Workflow

=== Testing Changes

. Make your changes to the Rust code
. Test locally with `cargo run`
. Build and test the Flatpak version:
+
[source,bash]
----
pixi run flatpak-build
pixi run flatpak-run
----

=== Updating Dependencies

When Cargo dependencies change:

. Update `Cargo.toml` as needed
. Regenerate the sources file:
+
[source,bash]
----
pixi run flatpak-generate-sources
----
. Test the build:
+
[source,bash]
----
pixi run flatpak-build
----

== Flatpak Manifest Structure

The manifest (`io.github.mfat.systemdpilot.yml`) defines:

* *Runtime*: GNOME Platform 47
* *SDK*: GNOME SDK 47 with Rust extension
* *Permissions*: System access for systemd management, SSH for remote hosts
* *Build Process*: Rust/Cargo-based build with offline dependency fetching
* *Data Files*: Desktop integration files installed from `../data/` directory

=== Key Permissions

* `--system-talk-name=org.freedesktop.systemd1` - Access to systemd
* `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets` - Secure credential storage
* `--filesystem=home/.ssh:ro` - Read SSH keys
* `--share=network` - Network access for SSH connections

== Submission to Flathub

=== Initial Submission

. Fork the link:https://github.com/flathub/flathub[Flathub repository]
. Create a new repository for the application
. Copy the files from this directory
. Submit a pull request

=== Updates

For application updates:

. Update the manifest with new version information
. Update `generated-sources.json` if dependencies changed
. Update desktop integration files in `../data/` if needed
. Test the build locally
. Submit pull request to the Flathub app repository

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

*Build fails with missing dependencies:*

* Ensure `generated-sources.json` is up to date
* Check that all system dependencies are listed in the manifest

*Runtime errors:*

* Verify permissions in the manifest
* Check that all required files are installed correctly

*SSH/systemd access issues:*

* Ensure the proper D-Bus permissions are granted
* Verify file system access permissions

=== Debug Build

To debug issues:

[source,bash]
----
# Build with verbose output
flatpak-builder --verbose build flatpak/io.github.mfat.systemdpilot.yml

# Shell into the build environment
flatpak-builder --run build flatpak/io.github.mfat.systemdpilot.yml bash
----

== CI/CD Integration

The pre-push git hook automatically validates the Flatpak manifest. For CI systems:

[source,yaml]
----
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Validate Flatpak
  run: |
    sudo apt-get install flatpak-builder
    flatpak-builder --dry-run --disable-download build flatpak/io.github.mfat.systemdpilot.yml
